# https://leetcode.com/problems/word-squares/

# Given a set of words (without duplicates), find all word squares 
# you can build from them.

# A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the kth row and 
# column read the exact same string, where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, numColumns).

# For example, the word sequence ["ball","area","lead","lady"] forms 
# a word square because each word reads the same both horizontally and vertically.

# b a l l
# a r e a
# l e a d
# l a d y
# Note:
# There are at least 1 and at most 1000 words.
# All words will have the exact same length.
# Word length is at least 1 and at most 5.
# Each word contains only lowercase English alphabet a-z.
# Example 1:

# Input:
# ["area","lead","wall","lady","ball"]

# Output:
# [
#   [ "wall",
#     "area",
#     "lead",
#     "lady"
#   ],
#   [ "ball",
#     "area",
#     "lead",
#     "lady"
#   ]
# ]

# Explanation:
# The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does 
# not matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).
# Example 2:

# Input:
# ["abat","baba","atan","atal"]

# Output:
# [
#   [ "baba",
#     "abat",
#     "baba",
#     "atan"
#   ],
#   [ "baba",
#     "abat",
#     "baba",
#     "atal"
#   ]
# ]

# Explanation:
# The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does 
# not matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).
