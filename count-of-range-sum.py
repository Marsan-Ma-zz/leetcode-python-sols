# https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-range-sum/

# Given an integer array nums, return the number of range sums that 
# lie in [lower, upper] inclusive.
# Range sum S(i, j) is defined as the sum of the elements in nums between 
# indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.

# Note:
# A naive algorithm of O(n2) is trivial. You MUST do better than that.

# Example:
# Given nums = [-2, 5, -1], lower = -2, upper = 2,
# Return 3.
# The three ranges are : [0, 0], [2, 2], [0, 2] and their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.
